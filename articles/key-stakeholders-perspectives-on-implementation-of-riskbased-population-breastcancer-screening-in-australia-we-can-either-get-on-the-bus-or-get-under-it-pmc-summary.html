*   **Acceptability and Heterogeneity:**  There's significant attention paid to how women perceive and value risk-based screening.  The references highlight that acceptability isn't universal and that there's heterogeneity in how women weigh the benefits and risks.
*   **Implementation Challenges:** The paper likely addresses the practical challenges of implementing risk-based screening programs, including ethical considerations, the need for accurate risk assessment tools, and the complexities of communication with patients.
*   **AI and Technology:**  The inclusion of references like Salim et al. (2024) indicates the growing role of artificial intelligence (AI) in identifying women who might benefit from supplemental screening.
*   **Guidelines and Principles:** References to Wilson & Jungner (1968) and guidelines from organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) ground the discussion in established principles of screening.
*   **Systematic Reviews:** Several systematic reviews are cited, suggesting the paper draws on a broad synthesis of existing research.
*   **Australian Context:** The Daffodil Centre reference suggests a specific focus or connection to Australian breast cancer screening initiatives.

**How to Use This List (If You Were Reading the Paper):**

*   **Further Reading:** This list provides a great starting point for anyone wanting to learn more about breast cancer screening.
*   **Contextualization:** It helps understand the broader research landscape surrounding the paper's topic.
